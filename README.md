# Introduction

`mono-xs` offers a monorepo structure that leverages [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to efficiently manage [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com) applications.

This is a primitive template generated using the Turborepo CLI and NestJS CLI, so feel free to modify it to fit your specific needs and start developing. You don’t have to use everything in the template.

I've recently been enjoying deploying the backend to the [Fly.io](https://fly.io) platform, so Dockerfiles and related configurations are included.

While this setup enables deployment to multiple platforms, if you, like me, also favor Fly.io, you'll find that there's virtually no configuration needed from development to deployment.

### Required Knowledge:

- Monorepo structure (in this case, using Turborepo)
- Docker (if you intend to use Fly.io)
- Nestjs framework
- Next.js framework

You can attach your desired database stack and use it with this. (I use PostgreSQL)
